# Understanding the Drivers of Physical Security Contract Values

## Executive Summary

This document provides a plain-language interpretation of the factors that influence the annual value of U.S. federal physical security service contracts. Our analysis examined thousands of government contracts for security guard services and identified which characteristics are associated with higher or lower contract spending.

The findings reveal that contract values are primarily driven by the specific government agency involved, the geographic location of service delivery, and the particular security program under which the contract is awarded. Understanding these patterns can help policymakers, contracting officers, and industry participants anticipate cost structures and plan accordingly.

## Methodology Overview

We analyzed physical security contracts using a statistical model that examines how various contract characteristics relate to annual spending levels. The model evaluates each characteristic independently while accounting for the influence of all other factors simultaneously. This approach allows us to isolate the specific contribution each element makes to contract value.

The results are expressed as percentage impacts: positive percentages indicate characteristics associated with higher contract values, while negative percentages indicate characteristics associated with lower values. For instance, a "+2,000%" impact means that contracts with this characteristic typically have annual values approximately 21 times higher than the baseline, all else being equal.

---

## Major Positive Value Drivers

These characteristics are strongly associated with higher annual contract spending:

### 1. **Department of Labor Security Contracts (+9,438%)**

Contracts funded by the Department of Labor—particularly those managed by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (funding code 1601)—represent the highest-value security engagements in our dataset. These contracts involve specialized protective services for hazardous industrial environments, including mine inspection facilities and related federal installations.

**Why this matters:** Mine safety operations require highly trained security personnel familiar with industrial hazards, emergency response protocols, and the unique access control needs of dangerous work environments. This specialization commands premium pricing.

### 2. **Department of Energy Protective Force Services (+9,104%)**

The Department of Energy's dedicated protective force program delivers security for some of the nation's most sensitive facilities, including nuclear laboratories, weapons storage sites, and research installations. These are among the most expensive security contracts in the federal portfolio.

**Why this matters:** DOE protective forces are not conventional security guards—they are armed federal officers trained to protect nuclear materials and classified research. The program demands extensive background investigations, weapons proficiency, tactical training, and continuous certification. These requirements substantially increase personnel costs and contract values.

### 3. **NASA Integrated Protective Services Contract (+6,774%)**

NASA's Integrated Protective Services Contract (IPSC) provides comprehensive security across NASA centers and facilities nationwide. This program consolidates multiple security functions under centrally managed task orders.

**Why this matters:** NASA facilities house aerospace technology, satellite systems, mission control operations, and astronaut training centers—all requiring sophisticated access control, visitor management, and protective intelligence capabilities. The integrated nature of the program produces economies of scale while maintaining high service standards, resulting in large contract values.

### 4. **Department of Energy Finance Office Contracts (+5,514%)**

Contracts awarded through the DOE Office of the Chief Financial Officer (awarding sub-agency code 1205) tend to have substantially elevated values. These contracts often support headquarters operations and national program coordination.

**Why this matters:** Security services procured at the headquarters level typically support multiple facilities or provide enterprise-wide protective capabilities, such as security operations centers, threat analysis, or coordinated emergency response. This centralized approach increases individual contract size even while potentially reducing overall program costs.

### 5. **Brazil-Sourced Services (+3,743%)**

Contracts specifying Brazil as the country of origin for services or products demonstrate notably higher values. This typically indicates security services delivered to U.S. embassies, consulates, or other federal facilities located in Brazil.

**Why this matters:** International security operations face unique challenges: language requirements, familiarity with local law enforcement and legal systems, coordination with host-country security services, and elevated threat environments. Contracts must also account for currency exchange considerations and international workforce management, all of which increase costs.

### 6. **Logistics Support Services (+2,676%)**

Contracts categorized under "Logistics Support Services" (product/service code description) carry substantially higher annual values than standard guard services.

**Why this matters:** Logistics support encompasses more than stationary guard posts—it includes mobile security teams, convoy protection, secure transportation services, and integrated support for complex operations. These services require vehicles, communications equipment, route planning, and coordination capabilities beyond traditional static guard duties.

### 7. **Department of Energy (Overall Agency) (+2,379%)**

Beyond the specific DOE programs mentioned above, any contract awarded by the Department of Energy as a whole (agency code 089) tends to have elevated values.

**Why this matters:** DOE's mission—overseeing nuclear weapons, nuclear energy, and advanced scientific research—inherently requires premium security services. Even contracts outside the dedicated protective force program must meet stringent security standards, background investigations, and specialized training requirements.

### 8. **Iraq-Based Services (+2,302%)**

Security contracts performed in Iraq show significantly elevated annual spending. This reflects both the higher costs of operating in conflict zones and the premium associated with high-threat environments.

**Why this matters:** Security personnel serving in Iraq face elevated personal risks and require extensive training, hardship compensation, insurance coverage, and logistical support. Contractors must maintain secure housing, armored transportation, medical evacuation capabilities, and risk management infrastructure—all of which substantially increase contract costs.

### 9. **Department of Energy (Agency Code 1100) (+2,080%)**

This specific DOE agency code corresponds to additional headquarters or enterprise-level security procurements with elevated spending patterns similar to those discussed above.

### 10. **Costa Rica-Based Services (+1,825%)**

Like Brazil, security services delivered in Costa Rica—typically at diplomatic facilities—command premium pricing due to international operational requirements and specialized personnel needs.

### 11. **Specific Service Code L042 (+1,722%)**

Product or service code L042 represents a specialized category within physical security that commands higher values. This code may encompass specific technical security services or integrated protective solutions.

### 12. **DOE Sub-Agency Code 8900 (+1,442%)**

Additional DOE organizational units (funding sub-agency 8900) demonstrate the department's consistently high spending on protective services across its decentralized structure.

### 13. **France-Based Services (+1,410%)**

Security operations in France, likely supporting embassy or NATO-related facilities, show elevated costs consistent with other international security missions.

### 14. **Medicare and Medicaid Centers Guard Services (+1,368%)**

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), part of the Department of Health and Human Services, operate large facilities that process sensitive health information and benefit payments. Security contracts for these facilities carry elevated values.

**Why this matters:** CMS facilities require protection against fraud, privacy breaches, and physical threats to staff processing billions of dollars in healthcare claims. Guards must understand HIPAA privacy requirements, controlled access zones, and specialized visitor screening procedures.

### 15. **Madagascar-Sourced Services (+1,185%)**

Security services sourced from or delivered in Madagascar demonstrate elevated costs, likely reflecting embassy or diplomatic facility protection in a location with limited security infrastructure.

---

## Major Negative Value Drivers

These characteristics are strongly associated with lower annual contract spending:

### 1. **Madagascar Performance Location (-98.4%)**

While services *sourced* from Madagascar show elevated values, contracts where Madagascar is listed as the *primary performance location* show dramatically reduced spending—approximately 98% lower than baseline.

**Why this matters:** This apparent contradiction reflects data classification nuances. Small guard posts at minor consular offices or local-national guard forces operating under minimal supervision may be recorded differently than U.S.-managed security programs. The negative coefficient suggests these are low-cost, locally staffed operations rather than premium protective services.

### 2. **Costa Rica-Sourced Services (Origin Code) (-98.2%)**

Similar to Madagascar, when Costa Rica appears as the *origin* code (rather than performance location), contracts show substantially lower values.

**Why this matters:** This likely distinguishes between high-value diplomatic security programs (positive driver #10) and lower-cost locally contracted services. Local guard companies providing basic perimeter security operate at much lower cost points than international security firms deploying U.S.-supervised teams.

### 3. **DOE Sub-Agency Code 8900 (Alternative Classification) (-95.8%)**

Interestingly, the same DOE sub-agency code that appeared as a positive driver also surfaces as a negative driver under different contract structures.

**Why this matters:** This suggests significant heterogeneity within DOE security contracting. Large, enterprise-level protective services increase contract values, while smaller, facility-specific guard posts for administrative buildings reduce them. Not all DOE facilities require nuclear-certified protective forces—many need only standard commercial guard services.

### 4. **Department of State (Agency Code 061) (-95.4%)**

Contracts awarded by the Department of State show substantially lower annual values compared to DOE or Department of Labor security programs.

**Why this matters:** While State Department diplomatic security is crucial, many guard contracts support administrative facilities, passport agencies, and domestic offices rather than high-threat embassies. These standard guard services operate at conventional commercial rates. High-value diplomatic protection typically flows through different contract vehicles or the Diplomatic Security Service's specialized programs.

### 5. **Panama-Sourced Services (-95.1%)**

Security services originating from Panama demonstrate the same pattern seen with Costa Rica and Madagascar—locally sourced services operate at substantially lower cost points.

### 6. **Specific Funding Sub-Agency 1645 (-95.0%)**

This particular funding office awards contracts with notably lower annual values, suggesting a focus on routine guard services rather than specialized protective operations.

### 7. **Specific Funding Agency 424 (-94.2%)**

Funding agency code 424 demonstrates consistently lower contract values, likely indicating standard commercial guard services rather than premium protective programs.

### 8. **Tanzania-Sourced Services (-93.5%)**

Continuing the pattern of lower values for locally sourced international security services, Tanzania-based contracts reflect commercial guard operations at regional wage rates.

### 9. **"DCGM FILE FY 19 AREA WIDE" Program (-93.4%)**

This administrative program designation corresponds to lower-value contracts, possibly representing routine annual guard services procured under simplified or regional contracting vehicles.

**Why this matters:** "Area wide" contracts often consolidate numerous small guard posts into a single procurement for administrative efficiency. While the aggregate contract may be substantial, the annualized value per location—which is what the model measures—remains modest.

### 10. **Pacific Islands Services Program (-93.2%)**

Guard services for U.S. facilities in Pacific island territories show reduced annual spending, reflecting smaller installations and locally recruited workforces.

**Why this matters:** Federal facilities in Guam, American Samoa, and other Pacific territories generally operate at smaller scales than mainland installations, with guard forces sized accordingly. Local wage rates in these territories also tend to be lower than continental U.S. markets.

### 11. **Specific Funding Agency 013 (-92.6%)**

This funding source is associated with lower-cost security contracts, consistent with routine guard services rather than specialized protective programs.

### 12. **Regional Security Service Contract Program (-92.6%)**

"Regional" security contracts demonstrate lower per-installation annual spending, following the same pattern as "area wide" procurements.

**Why this matters:** Regional consolidation strategies intentionally group multiple small guard posts into single contracts for administrative efficiency. This reduces per-location contract size even while potentially reducing overall program costs through economies of scale.

### 13. **Service Code Y1AA (-92.3%)**

This specific product/service code represents low-value security activities, likely basic guard services without specialized requirements or premium qualifications.

### 14. **Slovakia-Sourced Services (-91.6%)**

Security services sourced from Slovakia follow the established pattern of lower costs for locally contracted international guard services.

### 15. **United Arab Emirates Performance Location (-91.1%)**

Guard services performed in the UAE demonstrate reduced annual spending compared to baseline, likely reflecting locally recruited forces operating under commercial guard contracts.

**Why this matters:** While the UAE hosts important U.S. military and diplomatic facilities, many installations employ local security companies that operate at regional wage rates. Premium close-protection and tactical security services would be captured under different contract vehicles.

---

## Key Interpretive Themes

### Geographic Patterns

International security contracts show a clear bifurcation:
- **High-cost operations:** Contracts supporting major diplomatic missions, conflict zones (Iraq), or integrated international programs command premium pricing.
- **Low-cost operations:** Locally sourced guard services in stable regions (Panama, Slovakia, UAE) operate at conventional commercial rates tied to local wage markets.

### Mission Criticality

The highest-value contracts consistently support:
- **Nuclear security:** DOE protective forces and related programs
- **Critical infrastructure:** NASA facilities, mine safety installations
- **Hazardous environments:** Locations requiring specialized emergency response capabilities

Conversely, lower-value contracts support:
- **Administrative facilities:** Routine office security
- **Small installations:** Consular offices, regional field offices
- **Standard commercial services:** Guard posts without specialized requirements

### Procurement Structure

Contract values respond to procurement organization:
- **Centralized programs:** Enterprise-wide or headquarters-level contracts consolidate requirements and increase individual contract size
- **Regional consolidation:** Area-wide contracts reduce per-location spending through economies of scale
- **Specialized program vehicles:** Named programs (IPSC, Protective Force Services) signal premium service requirements

### Socioeconomic Considerations

While not captured in these top drivers, the companion gradient-boosted model (which can detect non-linear relationships) identified that self-certified small disadvantaged businesses receive substantially higher contract values. This suggests federal policy successfully channels premium security work to firms meeting diversity and inclusion goals—an intentional program design feature rather than an unintended cost premium.

---

## Practical Applications

### For Policymakers

Understanding these drivers enables more informed budget planning. When establishing new security requirements, the agency involved, mission criticality, and geographic location will largely determine cost structures. Decisions to centralize procurement or pursue regional consolidation strategies have predictable effects on contract sizing.

### For Contracting Officers

These patterns provide benchmarks for cost reasonableness determinations. Security contracts that deviate substantially from these established patterns merit additional scrutiny—either to verify legitimate mission-specific requirements or to identify potential inefficiencies.

### For Industry

Companies pursuing federal security work can better target their capabilities toward high-value or high-volume contract categories. The analysis clarifies that premium pricing attaches to specialized capabilities (nuclear security, hazardous environment operations, international coordination) rather than basic guard services.

### For Researchers

The sharp distinction between DOE/NASA/DOL security programs and more conventional guard services suggests these markets function almost as separate industries. Future workforce development, training standards, and policy initiatives may need to account for these fundamental differences in mission requirements and cost structures.

## Limitations and Caveats

This analysis examines statistical associations, not causal relationships. The model identifies which characteristics *accompany* high or low contract values but cannot definitively prove that any particular characteristic *causes* those values.

Several important nuances:

1. **Data Classification Matters:** The difference between "country of origin" and "performance location" codes produces opposite effects (Madagascar, Costa Rica), highlighting that administrative data fields sometimes capture different aspects of complex international operations.

2. **Omitted Variables:** Factors not recorded in the contract database—such as specific site threat assessments, protective intelligence requirements, or emergency response capabilities—undoubtedly influence costs but cannot be captured in this model.

3. **Selection Effects:** High-value contracts may flow to particular agencies *because* those agencies manage inherently expensive missions, not because the agency itself drives costs upward. The model identifies the pattern but cannot fully separate mission requirements from organizational effects.

4. **Temporal Changes:** The model pools contracts across multiple fiscal years (2008–2025). Security requirements, procurement strategies, and cost structures evolved over this period. The coefficients represent average relationships across this entire timeframe.

5. **Contract Modifications:** The data captures contract actions as recorded, but complex modifications, option exercises, and performance changes may blur the relationship between initial contract characteristics and final realized costs.

## Advanced Analysis: Gradient-Boosted Model Insights

While the linear model examined each characteristic independently, a gradient-boosted model can detect complex, non-linear interactions between multiple factors. This advanced approach achieved substantially better predictive accuracy (R² = 0.49 versus 0.35 for the linear model), revealing policy-relevant patterns that linear analysis cannot capture.

The gradient-boosting approach measures "relative importance" rather than directional coefficients. Higher importance scores indicate that a characteristic plays a larger role in distinguishing high-value from low-value contracts, but the relationship may be non-linear or conditional on other factors.

### Top Drivers in the Gradient-Boosted Model

#### 1. **Self-Certified Small Disadvantaged Business (Importance: 0.358)**

This single characteristic is by far the most powerful predictor of contract value—more influential than all other factors combined. Contracts awarded to firms that self-certify as small disadvantaged businesses show systematically different value patterns.

**Why this matters:** Federal acquisition policy actively encourages agencies to award contracts to small disadvantaged businesses through set-aside programs, evaluation preferences, and socioeconomic contracting goals. The strong importance of this variable suggests that these policy mechanisms successfully channel substantial security work to qualifying firms.

This does not necessarily indicate that disadvantaged business status itself *causes* higher values. Rather, it reveals that government agencies pursuing inclusion goals tend to structure contracts, define requirements, and evaluate proposals in ways that result in different value distributions. Premium security programs may deliberately incorporate disadvantaged business participation as a program design element, or qualifying firms may concentrate in particular market segments (specialized services, geographic regions, or agency relationships) that command higher values.

The finding validates that socioeconomic contracting policy materially affects the security services marketplace—it is not merely a procedural checkbox but a significant determinant of which firms receive which types of work at what value levels.

#### 2. **Award Type Code (Importance: 0.177)**

How contracts are structured—as definitive contracts, purchase orders, delivery orders, or blanket purchase agreements—strongly predicts their value.

**The Four Primary Award Types:**

- **Code D – Definitive Contract (16,950 contracts):** Traditional stand-alone contracts with specified scope, price, and performance period. These represent complete, self-contained procurements where the government knows exactly what it needs and negotiates a firm agreement. Median annualized value: **$301,000**.

- **Code C – Delivery Order (89,434 contracts):** Task orders issued against pre-existing IDIQ contracts or other ordering vehicles. Agencies establish broad contract terms with one or multiple vendors, then issue specific delivery orders as requirements emerge. This is the most common structure in our dataset. Median annualized value: **$134,000**.

- **Code A – Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) Call (17,586 contracts):** Simplified ordering mechanisms, typically used for recurring purchases of similar services at pre-negotiated prices. BPAs streamline repetitive procurements by establishing pricing and terms upfront, then issuing simple "calls" against the agreement. Median annualized value: **$87,000**.

- **Code B – Purchase Order (65,155 contracts):** The simplest acquisition method, typically for straightforward commercial purchases under simplified acquisition thresholds. Purchase orders involve minimal negotiation and documentation. These are the most numerous but smallest in value. Median annualized value: **$25,000**.

**Why this matters:** Contract structure reflects acquisition strategy and mission complexity. The data reveal a clear hierarchy:

- **Definitive contracts** command the highest values because they support specialized, complex missions requiring comprehensive statements of work, detailed performance requirements, and extensive security specifications. Nuclear protective forces, critical infrastructure security, and high-threat international operations typically use definitive contracts.

- **Delivery orders** balance flexibility with moderate values, serving as the workhorse of federal security procurement. They allow agencies to adjust guard force sizes, shift coverage between facilities, and respond to changing threat levels while maintaining pre-competed rates. Major security programs at NASA, DOE, and other agencies rely heavily on delivery order vehicles.

- **BPA calls** serve routine, recurring needs—standard guard posts that operate year after year with minimal variation. The pre-negotiated pricing and streamlined ordering reduce administrative burden for both government and contractors.

- **Purchase orders** handle the smallest, simplest requirements—temporary guard coverage, event security, or minor facility protection that doesn't justify formal contracting processes.

The high importance of award type indicates that acquisition strategy and contract vehicle selection are not merely administrative choices but fundamental determinants of program cost structure. Agencies pursuing integrated, flexible security solutions use delivery order mechanisms; those procuring simple guard services use straightforward purchase orders or BPA calls. The two approaches produce systematically different value patterns—and the gradient-boosted model detects these structural differences as the second-most important predictor of contract value.

#### 3. **Action Date Fiscal Year (Importance: 0.102)**

When a contract is awarded significantly influences its value, even after accounting for inflation adjustments in the underlying data.

**Why this matters:** This temporal pattern likely captures several overlapping trends:

- **Policy evolution:** Acquisition strategies, socioeconomic goals, and procurement regulations change over time, affecting how agencies structure and value security contracts.
- **Threat environment shifts:** Security requirements intensified following specific events (September 11, 2001; COVID-19 pandemic; facility attacks) and subsequently stabilized, creating temporal clusters of high- or low-value procurement.
- **Budget cycles:** Federal security spending responds to Congressional appropriations, continuing resolutions, and sequestration pressures that vary by fiscal year.
- **Market maturation:** The security services industry consolidated and professionalized over the 2008-2025 study period, potentially affecting competitive dynamics and pricing structures.

The importance of fiscal year suggests that understanding contract values requires situating them in their specific policy and budgetary context—comparisons across widely separated time periods may be misleading.

#### 4. **Solicitation Procedures (Importance: 0.053)**

How agencies compete contracts—through negotiated proposals, simplified acquisitions, or fair opportunity procedures—predicts values even in the non-linear model.

**Why this matters:** This validates the linear model's findings while adding nuance. The gradient-boosting approach can detect that solicitation procedures interact with other factors: negotiated competitions may produce different value patterns depending on the number of offers received, the agency involved, or whether subcontracting plans are required.

The moderate importance score (compared to top-ranking factors) suggests that *how* agencies compete is less determinative than *what* they buy and *who* provides it. Procurement method matters, but mission requirements and vendor characteristics matter more.

#### 5. **Performance Years (Importance: 0.038)**

Contract duration (length of the performance period) helps predict annualized values even though our target variable explicitly controls for duration by calculating annual spending rates.

**Why this matters:** This seemingly paradoxical finding reveals that contracts of different durations have systematically different annualized cost structures. Longer contracts do not simply spread the same work over more years—they represent fundamentally different security programs.

Possible explanations include:
- **Startup amortization:** Longer contracts amortize one-time costs (background investigations, training, security clearances, equipment procurement) over more years, reducing annualized spending.
- **Price stability:** Multi-year contracts lock in pricing that may become favorable as market rates increase, reducing effective annualized costs.
- **Learning curves:** Security contractors become more efficient as they gain experience at a specific facility, reducing staffing needs and hourly costs in later contract years.
- **Mission complexity:** Shorter contracts may concentrate in specialized, high-intensity missions (emergency response, temporary threat escalations), while longer contracts support routine, steady-state operations.

#### 6. **Type of IDC (Importance: 0.036)**

The specific category of indefinite-delivery contract vehicle (IDIQ, definitive contract, purchase order, etc.) predicts values independently of the broader award type code.

**Why this matters:** Within the category of flexible contract vehicles, subtle distinctions matter. Multiple-award IDIQs (where several contractors compete for individual task orders) produce different value patterns than single-award IDIQs (where one contractor holds exclusive ordering rights). Government-wide acquisition contracts (GWACs) and agency-specific IDIQs serve different missions and price points.

The importance of these fine-grained distinctions suggests that acquisition professionals' detailed vehicle selection decisions—not merely the general category—affect program costs.

#### 7. **Foreign Funding (Importance: 0.035)**

Whether a contract includes cost-sharing from foreign governments or international organizations strongly predicts its value.

**Why this matters:** Foreign funding typically indicates coalition operations, embassy security in partnership with host nations, or international facility protection where allied governments share costs. These arrangements emerge only for significant, strategically important installations—not routine guard services.

The importance of this variable reveals that international security cooperation concentrates in high-value programs. Contracts worth the diplomatic complexity of negotiating cost-sharing agreements represent premium protective missions.

#### 8. **Log Offers (Importance: 0.032)**

The logarithm of the number of offers received (a transformed version of the raw count) predicts values in a non-linear fashion.

**Why this matters:** Competition intensity affects pricing, but the relationship is not linear. The difference between one and two offers matters enormously; the difference between ten and eleven offers matters little. The logarithmic transformation captures this diminishing-returns pattern.

Importantly, this finding indicates that competition *does* occur even in negotiated procurements—agencies receive multiple proposals and select among them. The non-linear relationship suggests that minimal competition (2-3 bidders) provides most of the price discipline, with additional bidders offering decreasing marginal benefits.

#### 9. **Subcontracting Plan (Importance: 0.031)**

Whether the contractor must submit a subcontracting plan (typically required for contracts exceeding $750,000 with subcontracting opportunities) strongly predicts value.

**Why this matters:** Subcontracting plan requirements serve as a proxy for contract size and complexity. Large security contracts involve multiple specialized capabilities—access control systems, mobile patrols, K-9 units, emergency response, command centers—that prime contractors deliver through subcontractor networks.

The importance of this variable validates that complex, integrated security solutions command higher values than simple guard posts. It also suggests that federal socioeconomic policy—which requires prime contractors to provide opportunities for small, disadvantaged, and veteran-owned subcontractors—shapes high-value security procurements.

#### 10. **Awarding Agency Code (Importance: 0.029)**

Which specific federal agency awards the contract remains an important predictor even after accounting for numerous other characteristics.

**Why this matters:** Agency identity captures residual mission-specific factors not fully explained by program codes, funding sources, or other variables. Department of Energy security requirements differ fundamentally from Department of Agriculture requirements even for superficially similar guard services, reflecting classified operations, nuclear materials, threat environments, and security clearance needs.

The persistence of agency effects in the gradient-boosted model (which already accounts for dozens of other variables) indicates that organizational culture, risk tolerance, and mission context create genuine inter-agency cost differences beyond what observable contract characteristics can explain.

#### 11. **Number of Offers Received (Importance: 0.024)**

The raw count of competing proposals (alongside the logarithmic transformation discussed above) independently contributes to predictions.

**Why this matters:** Including both the raw count and logarithmic transformation allows the model to detect complex competition patterns. Some value categories may respond linearly to competition intensity; others may show threshold effects or diminishing returns.

#### 12. **Extent Competed (Importance: 0.021)**

The formal competition designation (full and open competition, limited sources, not competed, etc.) predicts values after accounting for solicitation procedures and offer counts.

**Why this matters:** Legal competition categories capture policy constraints beyond market dynamics. Sole-source justifications, exceptions to fair opportunity, and limited competition authorities apply in specific circumstances (urgent requirements, single qualified source, national security restrictions) that correlate with contract values.

Non-competed contracts are not necessarily more expensive—they may reflect emergency responses (potentially high cost) or routine administrative purchases (potentially low cost). The moderate importance score suggests these legal categories add information beyond what market-based measures (number of offers) already provide.

#### 13. **Funding Sub-Agency Code (Importance: 0.015)**

The specific sub-agency providing funding (distinct from the agency managing the procurement) predicts values independently of broader agency codes.

**Why this matters:** Security contracts often cross organizational boundaries: one office manages the procurement while another provides funding. This split reveals program versus administrative responsibilities. High-value protective programs may be centrally funded while locally administered, or vice versa.

The importance of funding source, separate from awarding authority, indicates that budget control matters. Offices controlling security appropriations shape program design even when delegating procurement execution.

#### 14. **National Interest Action (Importance: 0.014)**

Whether a contract receives "national interest action" designation (typically for emergency responses, disaster relief, COVID-19 pandemic response, etc.) predicts values.

**Why this matters:** National interest designations authorize expedited procedures, streamlined approvals, and relaxed competition requirements for urgent national priorities. Security contracts supporting pandemic response, hurricane recovery, wildfire emergencies, or crisis management operate under different constraints than routine procurements.

The importance of this variable reveals that emergency response security commands different values—potentially higher due to urgency premiums and mobilization costs, or potentially lower due to streamlined competition and standardized pricing.

#### 15. **Place of Manufacture (Importance: 0.013)**

Whether services or products must be domestically produced predicts contract values independently of performance location or country of origin.

**Why this matters:** "Place of manufacture" requirements often reflect Buy American provisions, Trade Agreements Act compliance, or Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) restrictions. These requirements limit the available vendor pool and may increase costs, but they also signal contracts for sensitive facilities where foreign national involvement is restricted.

The importance of manufacturing location, distinct from service delivery location, likely captures security clearance requirements, sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) access, and classified program participation—all of which substantially increase contractor qualifications and therefore contract values.

#### 16-20. **Additional Factors**

The remaining top-20 factors include:
- **Clinger-Cohen Act compliance:** IT security integration requirements
- **Country of product/service origin:** International sourcing patterns
- **Consolidated contract designation:** Multi-location bundling strategies
- **Major program identification:** Named security initiatives

Each contributes modest but meaningful predictive power, indicating that contract values respond to numerous interacting factors rather than a few dominant drivers.

## Interpretable Regression Tree Insights

To round out the modelling stack, we trained a single regression tree on the same filtered dataset used everywhere else (negotiated or simplified procedures only, annualized value bounds, positive performance years, and the explicit removal of `action_date_fiscal_year`). Despite its simplicity, the tree delivers an out-of-sample R² of roughly **0.40**—better than the linear baseline (0.35) and only a modest step behind the gradient-boosted ensemble (0.49)—while producing auditable rules that analysts can read directly from the plot embedded in the notebook (“Regression tree structure – top 2 levels”).

### What the tree reveals

1. **Funding agency is still the first lever.** The root node separates a compact group of funding-agency codes (the sequence starting at 005/010/012/013/014/015) from the remaining 35+ agencies. Those codes correspond to the same mission owners highlighted earlier—nuclear security, mine safety, space infrastructure, and other high-stakes programs—and their branch average exceeds $150K in annualized value. Everyone else immediately drops toward ~$30K, confirming that *who controls the money* dominates even in a rule-based model.
2. **Duration explains routine versus bespoke guard work.** For the bulk of agencies, the second split occurs at roughly **0.25 performance years** (10⁻⁰·⁵⁹). Awards shorter than a quarter-year behave like temporary guard posts unless the contracting officer tags the vendor as “other than small” (business-size code `O`), which pushes the prediction back above $110K. Longer periods (>1.4 years, i.e., log duration > 0.142) lead the tree to inspect `action_type_code` (new awards versus administrative modifications) and to distinguish between definitive contracts/purchase orders (award type codes A/B/C) and task orders (code D). Those structural choices explain most of the spread in multi-year awards.
3. **Sociodemographic levers change outcomes even in short runs.** Within the short-duration branch, `type_of_set_aside_code` determines whether values stay elevated. Set-asides aligned with 8(a), HUBZone, or Indian Small Business Economic Enterprise programmes retain materially higher annualized values than awards labelled “NONE” or limited to service-disabled veteran competitions. This mirrors the gradient-boosted finding that socioeconomic program design is not a side constraint—it actively reshapes price distributions.

Taken together, the tree offers a checklist a reviewer can follow without touching code: identify the funding agency code, confirm expected performance duration, note whether the action is a new award or a modification, and record the award/set-aside types. Those four observations reproduce the rule paths responsible for most of the model’s explanatory power, giving practitioners an interpretable bridge between statistical modelling and acquisition policy.

## Comparing the Two Models: What We Learn

### Linear Model Strengths

The log-linear regression excels at identifying **specific high-value programs and agencies**. It clearly flags Department of Labor mine safety contracts, Department of Energy protective forces, and NASA's IPSC program as top-dollar security missions. For policymakers seeking to understand *which specific organizations and programs* drive spending, the linear model provides unambiguous answers.

The linear model also effectively captures **geographic cost patterns**, distinguishing high-cost conflict zones (Iraq) from low-cost routine international operations (Madagascar, Panama, Slovakia).

### Gradient-Boosted Model Strengths

The gradient-boosting approach reveals **policy and structural factors** that shape the entire security services marketplace. It identifies socioeconomic contracting policy (disadvantaged business certification), acquisition strategy (contract vehicles and delivery order systems), and temporal trends (fiscal year effects) as fundamental determinants of value.

Importantly, the gradient-boosted model achieves R² = 0.49 compared to the linear model's R² = 0.35, meaning it explains 40% more variance in contract values. This improved prediction comes from detecting **non-linear interactions**: how competition intensity affects pricing depends on contract duration; how agency identity affects costs depends on socioeconomic programs; how solicitation procedures affect values depends on subcontracting requirements.

### Complementary Insights

Together, the models tell a complete story:

1. **Specific missions drive the extremes** (linear model): Nuclear security, mine safety, and NASA facilities command extraordinary premiums. Routine administrative security and small overseas posts operate at minimal costs.

2. **Structural policy shapes the middle** (gradient-boosted model): For the vast majority of contracts—neither extreme high-value nor extreme low-value—acquisition strategy, socioeconomic participation, contract vehicle selection, and competition structure determine outcomes.

3. **Geography matters differently** than initially apparent: The linear model shows that Iraq operations cost more than Panama operations. The gradient-boosted model reveals that what matters is not merely location but whether operations involve foreign funding partnerships, manufacturing restrictions, and national interest actions—nuanced policy factors that correlate with but are not reducible to geography.

4. **Competition is complex**: The linear model focuses on solicitation procedures (negotiated vs. simplified). The gradient-boosted model reveals that competition intensity (number of offers), competition extent (legal categories), and procedural choices interact non-linearly—minimal competition provides substantial price discipline, while heavy competition offers diminishing returns.

## Policy Implications from the Combined Analysis

### For Budget Formulation

**Lesson 1:** Do not assume linear scaling. Doubling contract duration does not halve annualized costs; doubling competition intensity does not linearly reduce prices. Budget models must incorporate non-linear relationships.

**Lesson 2:** Socioeconomic contracting goals materially affect security spending patterns. When planning new programs, explicitly account for disadvantaged business participation strategies—they are not cost-neutral administrative preferences but substantive program design elements.

**Lesson 3:** Contract vehicle selection is a first-order budget decision. Choosing between definitive contracts and delivery order systems affects not merely administrative flexibility but fundamental cost structures.

### For Acquisition Strategy

**Lesson 1:** Competition design matters, but incrementally. Achieving 3-5 competing offers provides substantial value; expanding beyond that yields diminishing benefits. Focus competitive efforts on preventing monopoly (1 bidder) rather than maximizing bidder counts.

**Lesson 2:** Subcontracting plans and integrated solutions correlate with high-value contracts. When mission complexity requires multiple specialized capabilities, expect premium pricing—and budget accordingly during requirements definition.

**Lesson 3:** Temporal context affects pricing. Security contracts awarded during national emergencies, policy transitions, or budget constraints operate under different market conditions than steady-state procurements. Benchmarking requires appropriate temporal comparisons.

### For Industry Analysis

**Lesson 1:** Market segmentation is real and pronounced. Nuclear security, mine safety, and critical infrastructure protection constitute a distinct market with specialized entry barriers, premium pricing, and concentrated participation. Firms cannot easily shift between premium protective services and routine guard markets.

**Lesson 2:** Socioeconomic certification creates market access. Small disadvantaged business status correlates with systematically different contract portfolios, likely reflecting set-aside programs, evaluation preferences, and teaming arrangements with large prime contractors.

**Lesson 3:** International operations bifurcate sharply. Coalition missions with foreign cost-sharing represent premium work; locally contracted guard services represent commodity markets. Geographic presence abroad does not automatically confer access to high-value contracts—mission criticality and partnership structures determine value.

### For Performance Measurement

**Lesson 1:** Cost comparisons require careful normalization. Agencies with different missions, different socioeconomic goals, and different acquisition strategies will show systematically different cost structures. Crude per-guard or per-hour comparisons mislead more than inform.

**Lesson 2:** Temporal trends matter. Fiscal year effects captured by the gradient-boosted model suggest that security costs respond to policy cycles, threat environments, and market conditions that vary over time. Performance benchmarks must account for when contracts are awarded, not merely what they cover.

**Lesson 3:** Observable contract characteristics explain only half the variance. Even the best-performing model (R² = 0.49) leaves 51% of cost variation unexplained. Site-specific threat assessments, facility configurations, emergency response requirements, and other factors not recorded in contract databases drive substantial cost differences. Performance metrics must incorporate mission context, not merely contract attributes.

## Conclusion

Federal physical security contract values are not distributed evenly across agencies, missions, or geographies. Instead, spending concentrates heavily in a small number of specialized programs protecting nuclear facilities, critical infrastructure, and hazardous environments. Meanwhile, the majority of guard contracts—supporting administrative facilities, small installations, and routine security needs—operate at conventional commercial rates.

This bifurcation reflects intentional policy choices: the federal government pays substantial premiums for specialized capabilities when mission requirements demand them, while relying on competitive commercial markets for standard guard services. Understanding these patterns enables more informed policy decisions, more effective procurement strategies, and more realistic budget planning.

Beyond this foundational insight, the advanced gradient-boosted model reveals that **how** the government structures security procurement—through socioeconomic participation requirements, contract vehicle selection, competition design, and acquisition timing—matters as much as **what** agencies buy. Policy mechanisms shape market outcomes. Inclusion goals, flexible ordering systems, and strategic competition design are not merely procedural overlays but fundamental determinants of who provides security services at what cost.

The analysis demonstrates that "security services" is not a homogeneous commodity but rather a spectrum spanning from basic access control (low cost, high volume) to nuclear protective forces (high cost, highly specialized). Effective management of the federal security portfolio requires recognizing and appropriately resourcing these fundamental differences in mission scope and capability requirements—while simultaneously understanding that policy design, acquisition strategy, and market structure shape how those resources are deployed and what outcomes they achieve.
